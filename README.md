# Chatroom in Go
This is a repo where I've built my first project on Go, a backend server for
handling websocket connections and establishing a chatting service using that.

The full setup of the server as well as deploying a local or live version of it
can be found in my [chatroom-salt repo](https://github.com/p-lemonish/chatroom-salt).
